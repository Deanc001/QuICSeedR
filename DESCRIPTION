Description: A toolkit for analysis and visualization of data from fluorophore-assisted seed amplification assays, such as such as Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) and Fluorophore-Assisted Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA). 'QuICSeedR' addresses limitations in existing software by automating data processing, supporting large-scale analysis, and enabling comparative studies of analysis methods.
